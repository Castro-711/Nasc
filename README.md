# Nasc
A server to handle device information

## Overview
Each directory contains different versions of the project. The final piece was *Nasc-12-refactored.ino* - this was used at the festival

## Improving development process
To make the development process faster I am adding a wifi extender & a raspberry PiTop out to the equipment in the shed. The main benefit of this will be to remotely develop, compile & install new sequences via the PiTop, hopefully increasing the development turnaround by removing the need to hardwire directly from the laptop to the arduino. 

### Testing out the Wifi Extender
